Polynomial Regression on Position Salaries Dataset
This repository contains a project that applies polynomial regression to analyze and predict the salaries of employees based on their position levels. The project utilizes Python and its data science libraries to build a predictive model that estimates employee salaries based on their position and level.

Project Features:
Data Collection:

Utilized a dataset containing information about employees, including their position, level, and salary.
Data Preprocessing:

Handling Missing Values: Ensured there were no missing values to maintain data integrity.
Feature Engineering: Created polynomial features from the position levels to capture the non-linear relationship between position levels and salaries.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Descriptive Statistics: Computed summary statistics to understand the data distribution and central tendencies.
Visualizations: Created scatter plots and histograms to visualize the relationship between position levels and salaries.
Model Building:

Polynomial Regression Model: Implemented a polynomial regression model using Python's scikit-learn library.
Degree Selection: Experimented with different degrees of polynomial features to identify the best fit for the data.
Model Training: Trained the model on the preprocessed dataset to learn the non-linear relationships between position levels and salaries.
Model Evaluation:

Performance Metrics: Evaluated the model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared score to assess its accuracy and reliability.
Visualization of Results: Plotted the polynomial regression curve to visualize the fit of the model to the data.
Documentation:

Jupyter Notebooks: Provided detailed Jupyter notebooks with code, explanations, and visualizations for each step of the process.
README Files: Included comprehensive instructions on how to run the project, interpret the results, and replicate the analysis.
Usage:
This project demonstrates how polynomial regression can be effectively applied to predict employee salaries based on their position levels. It serves as a practical example of using Python for advanced data analysis and machine learning, providing insights into the non-linear relationships between employee positions and their corresponding salaries.
